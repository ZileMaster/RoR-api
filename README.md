# Rails backend for the Personal Portfolio site

An ambitious take on Api building after just a few tries, and quite successful if i might add! Grasped a good foundation of the Rails --api, practiced with Postman, making routes,and controllers. Making models and linking them with Postgresql, validations and new concepts that i didn't know existed ( !new_record is a crazy good validation method! ). An extremely fun project im happy to do, and also a project that boosted my grade to the maximum, along with the ProjectKursovi backend! This was my first serious try at building a functional backend, and by that there were problems as always, but i overcame all of them by using common sense and google! Still not done, im planning on adjusting some models, adding functionalities to post likes, adding photos to posts, maybe even to users, we will see for that still. 
I learned many good concepts while making this, and all it took me was 4 extensive days and 5 lazy days to do it all, i learned Cors, linking with Postgres, ActiveRecords, api calls and json structures, and many more!

Hope you find the project amusing reader!
